# Package for  pairwise coherence computation of the Gray's data

For details on how to use it see the notebooks one to three:

1. Reading Gray Data, and computing pairwise coherence with GDa package.ipynb
2. Exploring the data.ipynb
3. Further exploring spectral, and spectral analysis class.ipynb

Here is a flowchart of the package:
